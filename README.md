# CoCo to CAS  
  
Convert CoCo binary `.bin`, tokenized Basic `.bas` or ASCII Basic `.asc` programs to the `.cas` cassette format.  
  
**CoCo to CAS** try to guess the file format based on the extension but it can be forced with the `-ff` argument.  
  
Run with:  
`cocotocas.py <input file> [output file] [-ff <bas|bin|asc>]`  
  
If no `output file` is given, the `input file` name will be used.
